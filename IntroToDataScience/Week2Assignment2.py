# Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on
# All Time Olympic Games Medals, and does some basic data cleaning.
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals,
# total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.
